# Database Seeding Guide

## 📋 Overview

This guide explains how to populate your MongoDB database with mock data for frontend development and testing.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run the Seeding Script

```bash
npm run seed:db
```

This will:
- ✅ Connect to MongoDB
- 🗑️ Clear existing data in all collections
- 📝 Create comprehensive mock data
- ✅ Display a summary of created records

### Environment Setup

Make sure your `.env` file has the correct MongoDB connection string:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/charity-db
```

```

⚠️ **Warning**: This will delete all existing data!

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Frontend Testing
- Test user authentication with different roles
- Display campaigns with various statuses
- Show donation history and statistics
- Test verification workflows
- Display organizational profiles

### API Testing
- All entities have proper ObjectId references
- Blockchain IDs are generated for most records
- Timestamps are set realistically
- Relationships are properly linked

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Script Location
`scripts/seed.ts`

### Dependencies Used
- `mongodb` - Direct MongoDB connection
- `bcrypt` - Password hashing
- `dotenv` - Environment variables
- `uuid` - Generating unique IDs

### Data Relationships
```
Users
  └── Organizations (userId, creatorId)
       └── Campaigns (organizationId, creatorId)
            └── Donations (campaignId, organizationId)

VerificationRequests → Users or Campaigns (entityType, entityId)
```

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Verify MongoDB is running
2. Check `.env` configuration
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
4. Check console output for specific error messages

## 💡 Tips

- The script uses Vietnamese names and locations for realistic testing
- All campaigns have realistic descriptions and Vietnamese context
- Donation amounts vary to test different UI scenarios
- Mix of blockchain IDs
 allows testing of both synced and unsynced records
- Verification statuses cover all workflow states
